#Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], 
#the second item has index [1] etc.
#When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the 
#items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
#Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, 
#add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
