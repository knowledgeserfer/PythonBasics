#Python is an object oriented programming language.
#Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
#A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
#To create a class, use the keyword class
class MyFavouriteNumber:
    favouriteNumber = 5
    
#Now we can use the class named MyFavouriteNumber to create objects
favNum1 = MyFavouriteNumber()
print(favNum1)
print(type(favNum1))
print(favNum1.favouriteNumber)
